<h1><i>A New Discovery for Finding the<br>
<span class="antiqua">Longitude</span>.</i></h1>

</div>

<p>For Finding the Longitude, it is to be noted, That if the true
Hour, and Minute of the Day, at the Place of our first <span class="gothic">Departure</span>,
and where we are <span class="gothic">Arrived</span>, can be both obtained, the
Difference of Longitude may be found, as truly as the Difference of
Latitude.</p>

<p>For which purpose the <i>Spring-Movement</i> hereunto subjoined, is
most humbly proposed to effect the same, even to the Tenth of a
Minute of Time. So that should the Error of a Minute happen to
be found in Practice, it must proceed from the Influence or Vicissitude
of the Air, and not from any Defect in the Rules by which the said
Movement is composed, as will plainly appear by the Explication
thereof, in the following Lines; and first of</p>

<h2><i>The Description of the said Movement.</i></h2>

<p>This Movement may be either of the Form and Bigness of that in
a Common Clock; or else of the Smallness of a Pocket Watch, as may
be thought convenient in Practice. But the larger it is, the better the
Divisions in the <i>Horologe</i> will appear. And as for the Numbers, they
may be at pleasure: Only this must be observ’d, That the swiftest Index
must make just One Revolution, whilst the slow one goes but One
of the Hundred Divisions, (as is common in Minute Watches, wherein
60 Minutes goes to an Hour) but the rest of the Numbers may be
at pleasure, as aforesaid. And if the Slowest moves round in 3, 4, or
5 Days; and the Movement requires to be wound up once in 26 or 27
Hours, it will be sufficient: For the more Vigor the Motion is calculated
for, the less the Air will affect it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<h2><i>How to set it first in Motion.</i></h2>

<p>When it is finished, let it go for a Month or two; after which put
the two <i>Indexes</i> right one with the other, and both of them pointing
just to 100. Then the Spring being wound up, keep it from Going
(with the Key) till the Shadow of the Sun is exactly come to a <i>Meridian</i>
Line, which must be rightly prepared for that purpose. Then let it
go till the Shadow comes just to the same Line the next Day, or rather
40, 50, or 100 Days after, (the longer the Better.) At which time enter
down the <i>Centesms</i> that the swiftest <i>Index</i> points to, as also the <i>Integers</i>
and <i>Tenths</i> of the slowest, (but put the last first in your Numbers) by
this you will be furnished with two general Numbers, <i>viz.</i> the said
Numbers pointed to, and the Time (in Hours) spent therein, to find
the Hour of the Day to the Tenth of a Minute, at any time; for that
Place where it was so set going, tho’ you remove it afterwards to any
Distance whatsoever. Which two Numbers ought to be entered in a
Book; to be used whensoever you would find the Hour of the Day.</p>

<p>And it is to be noted, That if the Sun be not then in its Mean Motion,
you must Add to, or Substract from what the <i>Indexes</i> do Give,
according to the Inequality thereof: But if you try it for one whole
Year, there will be no need of either. And that what is said may be
the better understood, I shall give an Example.</p>

<h2><i>How to find the Hour and Minute of the Day at <span class="antiqua">London</span>,
by the said Movement.</i></h2>

<p>Suppose it should be made for the Slowest to Revolve in about five
Days, and after it has gone just two Days, the Slowest <i>Index</i> should then
point between 39 and 40, and the Swiftest to 21.5. Then both these
Numbers (as set in Order) will make 3921.5. And if the Sun be in its
Mean Motion (if not, you must Add or Substract, as aforesaid) then
the said Numbers 3921.5 must always be the First; the said two Days,
or 48 Hours, the Second; and the two Numbers pointed to by the
<i>Indexes</i>, at the time for which you would find the Hour and Minute of
the Day (as suppose the slow one should point to 87, and the swift one
to 65.2, both making 8765.2) must be the Third; by which the Fourth
will be obtained as followeth: Which Fourth Number being Divided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
by 12, the Remainder will be the Hour and Minute of the Day at <i>London</i>,
as was required.</p>

<p class="noindent">Which being devided by 12, leaves remaining 4.84 ho. or 4 ho. 50.4 min.

will be found, as before directed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>And seeing it was near the Winter Season: If you should add the Autumn
and Winter Numbers, and Hours respectively together; and
make them the two first Numbers in your Proportion; it would Æquate
the Seasons more exactly: I mean, if the said Numbers had been really
entred from Practice; but these are only supposed. And by this method
you may Æquate the Numbers for finding the true Hour and Minute at
any Season; or for any other Latitudes whatsoever.</p>

<h2><i>How to find the Hour and Minute, at the place where you
are, when abroad, either at Sea or Land.</i></h2>

<p>For Solving this, there are Two Ways, the First and Infallible is,
when the Sun is either Rising or Setting; at which times, if the Air
be clear, observe what Numbers are pointed to by the two <i>Indexes</i>,
(but observe the swiftest first, because it will soon be removed) just as
the Center of the Sun is in the Horizon; and enter both the Numbers
down, as before directed, with the Day of the Month, and the Latitude
you are then in: Which having done, by the following Cannon, say,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>As ℞</p>

<p class="noindent">Is to t. c. of the Sun’s Decl.</p>

<p class="noindent">So is t. Lat.</p>

<p class="noindent">To s. c. of an Angle; which, if converted into Time (by
15) Gives the Hour and Minute of the Sun’s Rising from
Midnight; and if Substracted from 12 ho. gives the Setting.
Which shews the true Hour and Minute at the Place where
you then are, either at Sea or Land.</p>

</div>

<p>The Second way for Solving the said Question, is by taking the Sun’s
Altitude, when about 5 or 10 degrees above the Horizon; and at the
same time let another Person see what Number the Swiftest Index
points to, and after that the Slowest: Then put them both down as before
directed, with the Day of the Month, and the Latitude of the place
where you are; then have you the Sun’s <i>Altitude</i>, the said <i>Latitude</i>,
and the Sun’s <i>Declination</i>, to find the Hour and Minute of the Day at
the place required.</p>

<p>Now having by the said Observations and Cannons found the Hour
and Minute of the Day for the Place where you are, when abroad; and
by the Numbers pointed to, by the two Indexes, also found the Hour
and Minute that it is at <i>London</i>, (if the Movement was there set going;)
If you take the Lesser of these from the Greater, and bring the Remainder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
into Minutes, it will give the difference between the two places
in <span class="gothic">Time</span>; by which you may find their difference of Longitude either
<i>East</i> or <i>West</i> to a Minute, by the following proportion, (<i>viz.</i>)</p>

<p>Suppose the Difference of Time was 37 Minutes, then say,</p>

<p>Which 9 deg. 15.5. min. being added to, or taken from the Longitude
of the Place, where the said Movement was first set in Motion,
gives the Longitude you are come into, as effectually as the Latitude is
obtained by Observation, as was at first proposed. So that it is evident,
that if any defect should be found in practice, it must proceed
from the Vicissitude of the Air; and not from any Deficiency in this Discovery,
or from the Cannons relating thereunto.</p>

<p>And that we may Answer all <i>Objections</i>, which may arise, on Account
of the said Vicissitude of the Air, Motion of the Ship, Foulness of the
Movement, <i>&amp;c.</i> as well as render this Discovery more intelligible, we
will descend to speak thereof more particularly: And,</p>

<p>In the first place, let Five or Six (or what Number you please) of
these Movements be made; and after they have gone for a Month or
two, (or if designed for the Sea, ’till within two or three Weeks of
your Sailing) then take them asunder, and set them going by the <i>Meridian</i>
Line, as before directed. And having entred down in the Book,
herein after mentioned, the Day of the Month, when set going; how
long it is making one Revolution; and what Number is produced, in
just Ten Days Motion, (all which must be done, before you Sail in
every Voyage;) Let them be carry’d to Sea, into any Latitude, (suppose
50 Deg. or <i>Newfoundland</i>) and at their Return bring them again
to the said <i>Meridian</i> Line, and thereby (with the help of the Number
of Days from their being first set in Motion) find the two first <span class="gothic">Proportional
Numbers</span>, as before directed: Which done, enter them in a
Book, peculiar to each Movement, (the Form whereof followeth) together
with the Latitude, and Season of the Year in which the Voyage
was made. Then will they all be fitted for a Voyage to <i>Newfoundland</i>,
and Parts adjacent, for any such Season. And so for any other, when
Tried and Entred, as now directed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>After which, send them all in a Ship bound to the Latitude of about
37 Deg. (suppose <i>Virginia</i>); and being returned, let the Numbers be
found and entred, as aforesaid, with the Latitude and Season; then
will any one, or all of them, be fitted for a Voyage, either to <i>Newfoundland</i>
or <i>Virginia</i>, or any of those Parts, for any such like Season; and
so for any other, when Tried and Entred as aforesaid.</p>

<p>This being done, send them also in a Ship, bound to the Latitude
of 13 Deg. (suppose <i>Barbados</i> or <i>Jamaica</i>;) and being returned, find
the Numbers, and enter them with the Latitude and Season: So will
they all be fitted for these several Latitudes, (<i>viz.</i>) 50 Deg. 37 Deg.
and 13 Deg. at such a Season: And by a like Process to the <i>Æquinoctial</i>,
and towards the <i>North Pole</i>.</p>

<p>Upon which several Tryals, you will have so many Movements fitted
for all the <i>North Hemisphere</i>, both for Hot, Cold and Temperate Seasons.
And, by only Counterchanging the Latitudes, for the whole
Globe; or at least for the Marine Parts thereof.</p>

<p>And to what is proposed to be Entred, in respect of Latitude and
Season, you may also add the Time of its being first set in Motion after
Cleansing; which Cleansing must be done only Annually, and as near
as may be on the same Day of the Month; which will much facilitate
the Inequality arising from its Foulness: By which all Objections will
be answer’d, and the Discovery render’d compleat and perfect. Especially
if a true <i>Meridian Line</i> be made in every considerable Port in this
Kingdom, and elsewhere; for Examining the Movement at your Arrival
abroad, and setting it in <i>Motion</i>, before your Departure. But
remember, that where you set it going, from thence your <i>Departure</i>
must be reckon’d.</p>

<p>And by this Method all the said Vicissitudes that may arise in respect
of Latitude or Seasons, Motion of the Ship (which will be near the
same in one Voyage, as in another) and Cleanness or Foulness of the
Work, will also plainly appear upon Record, (by comparing one Number
in the said Book with another) and will be Accounted for, and
Æquated, as occasion requires: Namely, by only taking such Numbers
from the said Book, to work your Proportion by, as are entred for
the Latitude and Season, that you are again Arrived to, or Sailing
under: As suppose into 50 Deg. in the Summer Season, then take the
Number and Hours answering thereunto; and so, if in Winter, those
for the Winter. By which proportionable Numbers, the said Contingencies
will be truly and effectually Allowed, and the Difference in
Motions justly Æquated, as was before asserted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Note</i>, That in this Movement, the <span class="gothic">Time</span> is Regulated or Conformed
to the <span class="gothic">Motion</span>: Whereas in former Movements, the <span class="gothic">Motion</span> is Regulated
or Conformed to the <span class="gothic">Time</span>. And this ought to be well understood,
before you can rightly comprehend what is herein contained.</p>
</div>

<p>Now that this Movement, or Discovery, does not only differ from, but
also far exceed, any that has hitherto been proposed; is evident in this
(<i>viz.</i>) That if any former Movement whatsoever be Timed here, as
usual, <span class="gothic">Before</span> it is carried to Sea, (tho’ never so exactly) yet the change
of Climate, <i>&amp;c.</i> will so affect it, as to make it go False: And if you fit
it there, then ’twill be also False when brought hither: But if by this
Movement, and the foregoing Rules, the said Numbers be found <span class="gothic">After</span>
it is returned from such a Voyage; all the said Defects or Contingencies
will be Æquated by the said Numbers only. So that it will be the same
in use, as if no such Accidents did attend it at all. And this Assertion
must, and will be granted, by every one that does fully comprehend the
Nature and Use thereof. For altho’ this <i>Horologe</i> has no certain <i>Hours</i>
or <i>Time</i> pre-assigned to it; yet it hath nevertheless, greater or lesser
Numbers Æquated to the Variableness of Motion or Time, (<i>viz.</i>) If fitted
to be used here in <i>England</i>, then it hath (or may have) one sort of
Numbers (or Time) for finding the Hour and Minute, in the Summer Season;
another for Winter; and a third for the Spring and Fall; one when
it lyeth undisturbed in one and the same place; another (if you please)
when carry’d always in a Rattling Coach. And on the other hand, if
you carry it to Sea, then it has one for the <i>Torrid</i>, one for the <i>Frigid</i>,
and a third for the <i>Temperate Zones</i>, &amp;c. And yet still but one and the
same <i>Horologe</i>, and but one and the same <i>Indexes</i>. So that all manner
of Natural Vicissitudes or Contingencies whatsoever, may be Regulated
or Æquated in and by the said Numbers; and consequently, the
true Hour and Minute of the Day, where it is first set going, may be
hereby as effectually found, as if no such Impediments did at any time
or place attend it, as aforesaid.</p>

<p>And as for what may be suggested in relation to the Inequality between
the Spring and Fusie, if any should be, it will be compensated,
in that there are five or six Windings up of them, to one Revolution in
the <i>Horologe</i>. So that there is nothing wanting to compleat this Discovery,
but to put it into Practice: And seeing the Charge and Trouble
is very Inconsiderable; and the Legislature by <i>Act of Parliament</i>, hath
been graciously pleased to Incourage hereunto, it is thought expedient
to make this publick Proposal, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>That if any one Person is willing to Engage in this so Noble an Enterprize,
he will be readily received as a Partner, on such Conditions
as may be Reasonably Concerted therein.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MEMORANDUM">MEMORANDUM.</h2>

</div>

<p>1. All Departures must be reckon’d from <i>London</i>, if the Movement
was there Set going.</p>

<p>2. That wheresoever they are Set going, there must be a large and
exact Meridian Line prepared by a Perpendicular, set up in an Horizontal
Circle, as is Mathematically taught, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>3. That an Equal time be spent in Winding it up, as near as possible;
for which no time need be allowed, if Equated for 10 or 12
Months; because the time required will be the same for the same time,
and greater for a greater, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>4. That the said Movement be carefully kept in one and the same
Temperature of Air, as near as possible.</p>

<p>5. That after this Movement is fully proved, if it should not (by
reason of any sudden change of Air) agree to a Minute, yet it ought not
in this respect to be altered or much regarded, because the moistness of
one Month, may compensate the Dryness of another: So that by such
time as you are arrived to the end of your Voyage, the Movement may
even Rectifie or Correct it self.</p>

<p>6. It is to be noted, That if the Sun comes too soon to the Meridian,
it will also come too soon to the Horizon; and therefore, Watch too
fast, or too slow, must be Added or Substracted, as aforesaid.</p>

<p>7. That it be always wound up, as near as may be, at one certain
time of the Day, (<i>viz.</i>) if at Sea, about Twylight, or Break of Day,
as may be thought expedient. And if it should happen to be omitted,
so long as to stand still; you must not set it going again, but by taking
it assunder, and putting the two Indexes together, and bringing the
Movement to the Meridian Line, as at first directed. Therefore when
at Sea be careful of such Omissions.</p>

<p>8. It is to be noted, That altho’ every Minute of Time, does Answer to
about 15 or 16 Miles <i>English</i>, under the <i>Equinoctial</i>; yet it is not above 9
or 10 Miles in our Latitude to one such Minute. And altho’ it be so many
under the Equinoctial, yet <i>there</i> the Sun’s Altitude will be taken very exact,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
because 90 degrees of Altitude, is for 6 hours of Time; whereas
in our Latitude, it is but 62 degrees, for 8 hours of Time; both which
Advantages will Facilitate the Practice. I shall at present conclude
with acquanting,</p>

<p>That if a common Minute Watch (by Filing or Loading the Ballance,
or otherwise) be made to go, or does already go, any unknown quantity
of Time, either too Fast, or too Slow; by this Device, we may find the
Hour and Minute of the Day by such a Watch, more exactly than can
be done by the best timed common Watch whatever. And this even
without touching it, other than by Winding up the Spring as usual.</p>

<p>There are other Improvements that may be made of this Discovery,
but I reserve them to some other Opportunity.</p>

<p><i>Note</i>, That the Numbers to be used after <i>Cleaning</i>, (<i>viz.</i> after <i>Sept. 5.
1715.</i>) are found by Substracting or Adding the Difference between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
the two Numbers in the Seventh Column, (<i>viz.</i> that of <i>Sept. 5.</i>) and
that of <i>Sept. 16.</i> (which is only 2.) out of the former Numbers to be
used for the same Latitude; on which there will remain 29274.2 for
the <i>New</i> Number to be used in Lat. 50. Deg. in <i>Autumn</i>, instead of the
former, until the next Cleaning, (which must be only Annually) and
so of the rest, from one Cleaning to another. And this method must
be used for the respective Latitudes, according as Observations shall be
made therein, and Numbers found to answer thereunto.</p>

<p><i>Note also</i>, That this Experiment may be sufficiently Tryed and Proved,
by only two or three Voyages, to the South-West parts of <i>Ireland</i>, or
to <i>Newfoundland</i> at farthest.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding what has been said, It is chiefly to be noted,
That altho’ I have proposed (for Example sake) that the General Numbers
should be found, by Sailing to <i>Newfoundland</i>, <i>Virginia</i>, <i>Barbados</i>, &amp;c.
and returning again to a <i>Meridian Line</i> at <i>London</i>: Yet if the <i>Honourable
Persons</i> before-mentioned in this Title-Page, to whom the whole
is most humbly submitted, will please to appoint a Ship for this purpose,
the said Numbers may be much better found in manner following;
(that is to say) By ordering that the said Ship shall first make a true <i>Meridian
Line</i>, at or near the Lat. of 60 Degrees; and thereby set the
Movements going, in manner aforesaid: After which let them Sail about
40 or 50 Leagues distant from the Shore, and there Cruise <i>Northward</i>
and <i>Southward</i> for about a Month’s time; after which let them
return again to the same <i>Line</i>, and find the Numbers, and also enter
them, as before directed. And having so done, let them make another
<i>Meridian Line</i>, about 15 Deg. more Southward, and there do in like
manner: And so at the like Distance to the <i>Equinoctial</i>. After which,
let them begin again, and repeat the same Process for three or four
times: By which means the Numbers will be found, and the different
Motion of the Movement discover’d, for all Latitudes and Seasons, as
near as needful.</p>

<p>And being returned home, by these Numbers we may find the true
<i>Difference</i> of Motion, in and for the several Latitudes and Seasons.
Which <i>Difference</i> must be entred in the 4th Column of the respective
Books, reserved for that purpose. By the help of which said <i>Differences</i>,
you may make as many Movements as may be needful, at any time;
as also Books and Numbers peculiar to each Movement. The <i>Rules</i> for
which will be imparted to any such Watchmaker, as may Reasonably
desire the same.</p>
